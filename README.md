# brain-gnn-transcriptomics: GNNs on Single-Cell Human Brain Data for AD/CNS Insights



## Project Overview
**One-liner:** A scalable Graph Neural Network (GNN) pipeline to analyze large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data from the **Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD)** to predict Alzheimer’s pathology and identify disease-associated gene modules.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end "AI for Drug Discovery" workflow. It processes raw single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data, constructs biological graphs (Cell-Cell and Gene-Gene), and trains GNNs to uncover molecular drivers of neurodegeneration.

### Key Features
- **Scalable Data Ingestion**: Handling large-scale CNS transcriptomic datasets (SEA-AD / Allen Brain Atlas).
- **biologically-Informed GNNs**:
  - **Cell-Level**: Predicting AD diagnosis and cellular resilience using GraphSAGE/GAT on cell-similarity graphs.
  - **Gene-Level**: Identifying target modules using gene co-expression and PPI networks.
- **Production-Grade**: Distributed training (PyTorch Lightning + DDP), Reproducible environments (Docker), and Cloud-ready deployment (FastAPI).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended for GNN training)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-gnn-transcriptomics.git
   cd brain-gnn-transcriptomics
   ```

2. Create the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate brain-gnn
   # Ensure deploy dependencies are installed if using pip fallback
   python -m pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

### Usage Pipeline

#### 1. Data Ingestion
Download SEA-AD data from public S3:
```bash
python scripts/download_sea_ad.py
```

#### 2. Preprocessing
Filter, normalize, and select Highly Variable Genes (HVGs):
```bash
python scripts/preprocess_scRNA.py
```

#### 3. Graph Construction
Build Cell-Cell (KNN) and Gene-Gene (Co-expression) graphs:
```bash
python scripts/build_graphs.py
```

#### 4. Training (Distributed)
Train the GNN model using PyTorch Lightning:
```bash
# Trains for 5000 epochs to ensure convergence on the graph
python scripts/train.py --model cell --data_path data/processed/graphs/cell_graph.pt --epochs 5000
```

#### 5. Deployment (API)
Serve the trained model via FastAPI:
```bash
# Start the server (autoreload enabled)
python -m uvicorn deploy.fastapi_app:app --reload
```

## Scientific Context
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by complex cellular interactions and gene expression changes. Traditional flat-file analysis misses the **relational structure** of biological systems. By modeling cells and genes as graphs, we leverage **Graph Neural Networks** to learn:
1. **Manifolds of Disease**: How healthy cells transition to a disease state in latent space.
2. **Gene Regulatory Networks**: Which gene modules drive this transition.

**Primary Dataset**: [SEA-AD (Seattle Alzheimer’s Disease Brain Cell Atlas)](https://sea-ad.org/) - Single-cell transcriptomics of the aging human cortex.
